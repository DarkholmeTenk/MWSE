Introduction
========================================================

Welcome to the MWSE-Lua interface. Starting in MWSE 2.1, modders are able to create powerful, event-driven modifications to *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind* using the `Lua`_ scripting language.

Unlike traditional mwscript, Lua scripting is responsive. Instead of checking every frame to see if an object is being activated, a mod might register to see if their reference was activated. This introduction covers the surface of the different components important to scripting with MWSE-Lua.

Lua files do not reside in esms/esps, but rather live in the \*Data Files/MWSE/ directory.

.. warning:: MWSE 2.1 is currently in pre-release design/testing. There are many mods out that use it, but it is being rapidly developed. There **may be breaking changes** before version 2.1 is fully released. Consider this before deciding to use MWSE in its current state.


Lua Scripting Language
--------------------------------------------------------

This guide is not meant to be a comprehensive introduction to the Lua language. Its syntax is simple. The following code block demonstrates what the language looks like:

.. code-block:: lua

    -- Define a simple function that takes a single parameter.
    local function myFunctionName(firstFunctionParameter)
        -- Print to the MWSE log, with the value that was passed.
        mwse.log("Called my function with parameter = %s", firstFunctionParameter)
    end

    -- Print "foo" to the MWSE log, prefixed with the function above.
    myFunctionName("foo")


Morrowind Object Types
--------------------------------------------------------

MWSE provides many bindings to more directly manipulate the object types that the Morrowind engine uses. In this example, we find the skooma object, and rename it *No-No Juice*.

.. code-block:: lua

    -- Tell MWSE that we want to find the skooma object.
    local skooma = tes3.getObject("potion_skooma_01")

    -- Set the skooma object's name.
    skooma.name = "No-No Juice"

A complete list of exposed TES3 types and their associated properties/functions can be seen on the respective `tes3 types`_ page.


Events
--------------------------------------------------------

Events are the primary way in which script modules interact with the game. There are many event hooks, covering everything from player level up to object collisions to world activations. Using an event typically looks like this:

.. code-block:: lua

    -- Define our callback, which will get called when the event happens.
    local myKeyEvent(eventData)
        if (eventData.pressed) then
            mwse.log("Key #%d was pressed.", eventData.keyCode)
        else
            mwse.log("Key #%d was released.", eventData.keyCode)
        end
    end

    -- Tell MWSE that we want our callback to be invoked when a key is pressed.
    event.register("key", myKeyEvent)

We can also pass filters to events. For the key event, the filter is the key that was pressed/released.

.. code-block:: lua

    -- If we use this instead of the above registration, we filter to key 22 (U).
    event.register("key", myKeyEvent, { filter = 22 })

The details of which events are available and what event data is exposed to them can be found on the `events`_ page.


Support Libraries
--------------------------------------------------------

On top of all this are support libraries to help make modding easier. An example library is `timer`_, which helps to manage time-based operations.

.. code-block:: lua

    -- Define the function we want to call when our timer completes.
    local myTimerCallback()
        tes3.messageBox({ message = "My timer completed!" })
    end

    -- Start a timer that finishes after 5 seconds.
    -- When it does finish it will call the above function.
    timer.start(5, myTimerCallback)


An Unsandboxed World
--------------------------------------------------------

MWSE does not do any sandboxing for mods. This enables clever innovations, like `Sky Diversity`_, without the need for externally running programs. This also means that MWSE mods can bring in any lua modules they wish to package. Additionally, they can bring in native code -- allowing powerful extensions that Oblivion and Skyrim have had for years.


Mod Initialization Scripts
--------------------------------------------------------

So how do you access all this, and start getting your fingers into the event systems? Unlike vanilla mwscript, Lua scripts are not explicitly restricted to an actively running game. They are also not restricted to esp files -- many MWSE-Lua mods do not require an esp (though may choose to see if an esp is active for an easier user experience).

By placing a file with the name ``main.lua`` inside the lua folder or any of its subdirectories, that file will get executed when the game is being initialized (e.g. before any esm/esp files are accessed).

For example, with the file ``Data Files/MWSE/mods/demo/main.lua`` in place, it will get executed. With the following contents, it will ensure that when a save game is loaded, we get the save game filename printed to our log.

.. code-block:: lua

    local myLoadedGameCallback(e)
        mwse.log("Loaded game: %s", e.filename)
    end
    event.register("loaded", myLoadedGameCallback)


Script Overrides and OpenMW Semi-Compatibility
--------------------------------------------------------

Another feature of MWSE-Lua is the ability to override the normal execution of mwscript. This means that if we have a script in an esp file called ``myScript`` we can do the following code to override its behavior:

.. code-block:: lua

    -- Use Data Files/MWSE/mods/demo/override.lua for our override.
    mwse.overrideScript("myScript", "mods/demo/override")

The override is a module. The file listed above must return a table, and that table should have an execute function, which will get run whenever the script would get run.

.. code-block:: lua

    local myOverrideModule = {}

    function myOverrideModule.execute()
        tes3.messageBox({ message = "I'm running from Lua, not mwscript!" })
    end

    return myOverrideModule


OpenMW will not be adding compatibility with MWSE mods, legacy or Lua-based. But script overrides exposes a way for modders to write mods that have extended MWSE functionality without causing issues in OpenMW. Basic functionality can be kept to mwscript, while the script can be overriden to enable advanced functionality using Lua.
